# beer

Just a very first test of SNAP SVG :)

Have fun with this delicious sparkling beer.

Demo: http://baggers.io/samples/beer

Note: the code is written in ES6 and it's not transpiled. Use the latest chrome to get a beer.

## Installation

Install SNAP SVG ...

```
npm i
```

Run it with any static server you want to. (e.g. node-static)
